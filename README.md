# Alduin-Emacs

This is the Emacs version of the [Alduin theme for Vim](https://github.com/AlessandroYorba/Alduin).

## Installation
This is a work in progress and is not yet available via Package.el

In order to install you will need to pull the repo and set the directory to your theme load path in your .emacs file.

```
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/path-until-repository/alduin-emacs/")
```

At that point you can use ```M-x load-theme RET alduin``` properly to load the theme.
